# Pawbnb üê∂
  
Pawbnb is a comprehensive full-stack web application I developed, aiming to replicate the seamless experience of Airbnb but exclusively for our beloved pets. Built using JavaScript, Node.js, React/Redux, HTML, CSS, Express.js, Sequelize, and Postgres, Pawbnb provides a dedicated platform where pet owners can find safe and comfortable spaces for their pets, ensuring they are just as cherished and cared for as human travelers. The application showcases my dedication to creating user-friendly interfaces and secure systems, reflecting my passion for enhancing user experiences within the pet-loving community.

At Pawbnb, all users, whether registered or not, can freely browse and explore pet-friendly spots, view details, and read reviews. However, to actively contribute, such as adding or editing spots, leaving reviews, or deleting reviews, signing up or logging in is required. For ease of demonstration, we offer a convenient demo user button to provide full access to the platform. Join our community and enhance your pet's adventures!
